# Phase 3: SERP CTR Optimization Implemented

## ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Title/H1 Strategy (`VerdictSeoService.java`)**
   - Implemented "Deterministic Randomness" to assign one of 3 hook patterns to each page:
     1. **Hidden Cost**: "5 Hidden Costs (2026)"
     2. **Safety/Fear**: "Is it safe to buy? (Risk Report)"
     3. **Curiosity**: "What realtors won't tell you"
   - Goal: Test different psychological hooks to maximize organic clicks.

## 🔜 Next Decision Point
- **Option A**: Deploy Phase 1-3 changes immediately to fix indexing and quality.
- **Option B**: Proceed to Phase 4 (Glossary Pages) to build "Linkable Assets".
